# Baby_Cry_Detection_Database

This novel dataset is a subset of the AudioSet, for Baby Cry detection task.
The curated dataset is divided into:
1. development set:
   The development dataset is further split into the training (Train) and validation (Val) sets. 
3. evaluation set

The dataset has been categorized into two main classes: "baby-cry" and "other". 
The "other" class comprises sound clips from the domestic household environment. 
Note:
    The recurrence of the events in the labels for each clip does not overlap. 
    The dataset contains an almost equal distribution of clips between `baby-cry' and `other' classes. 

The distribution for the dataset is as follows:
|---------------------------------------------|
| Set     | Development Set | Evaluation Set  |
|---------------------------------------------|
| Class   | Train  |   Val  |      Eval       |
| BabyCry |   492  |   39   |       25        |
|  Other  |   480  |   39   |       40        |
|  Total  |   972  |   78   |       65        |
