# Baby_Cry_Detection_Database

This novel dataset is a subset of the AudioSet, for Baby Cry detection task.
**The curated dataset is divided into**:
1. **development set**:<br />
   _The development dataset is further split into the training (Train) and validation (Val) sets._ 
3. **evaluation set**

The dataset has been categorized into two main classes: `baby-cry` and `other`. <br />
The `other` class comprises sound clips from the domestic household environment. <br />
**Note**:
    The recurrence of the events in the labels for each clip does not overlap. <br />
    The dataset contains an almost equal distribution of clips between `baby-cry` and `other` classes. <br />

The distribution for the dataset is as follows: <br />

|   **SET**   | **development Set** | **development Set** | **evaluation Set** |
|:-----------:|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|:------------------:|
|  **CLASS**  |       _TRAIN_       |        _VAL_        |       _EVAL_       |
